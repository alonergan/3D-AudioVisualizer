<h1>3D ThreeJS Audio Visualizer</h1>
<h3>Web application that visualizes audio data within a ThreeJS scene</h3>
<h5>** Working on getting this hosted for live demos **</h5>
<h6>This was an extension of my 2D Audio Visualizer project into 3D. This showcases how audio can be used to manipulate the geometry of a 3D object. 
For each frame of the audio buffer, the vertices of the shape are adjusted based on the bass frequency level and a noise function utilizing the treble frequency level</h6>

  <h4>Some concepts I worked on with this project:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Animating 3D scenes with morphable geometry objects with ThreeJS</li>
    <li>Processing audio frame data into seperate frequencies</li>
    <li>Modulating frequency data and using noise functions to generate new data for morphing</li>
    <li>Smoothing the data output to reduce extreme changes and inaccuracy</li>
  </ul>
